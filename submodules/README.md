Here are (hopefully) all the repos I stole work from.

## adi1090x/rofi
His rofi config is very nice, see also [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/fsx8bo/oc_rofi_new_applications_launchers_for_rofi/)

## sdushantha/dotfiles
His VIFM config is very nice, it compelled me to give it a try. See [this reddit thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/fx32el/oc_managed_to_get_audio_epub_pdf_video_image_and/)
I removed the epub and font preview functionality because I don't need it.
